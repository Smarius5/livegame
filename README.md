# LiveGame

LiveGame is a habit tracker with a reward system where you can exchange coins earned by completing tasks for activities that reinforce the reward system.


## How it works

1. Create habits and tasks
2. Define daily/weekly habits and one-off tasks. Each has difficulty, frequency, and XP/coin values.

### Earn XP and level up
Completing tasks earns XP. Leveling up unlocks badges, advanced stats, and optionally new habit categories.

### In-app economy
Tasks also grant coins. Spend them on self-defined rewards (e.g., “30-min game session,” “coffee out,” “1 TV episode”). Each reward has a configurable price.

### Custom reward shop
Build your personal catalog, set prices and limits (per day/week) to prevent overuse and keep rewards meaningful.

### Roleplay & commitment
Follow the golden rule: don’t redeem rewards unless you have enough coins. Treat coins as your leisure “budget.”

### Streaks and gentle penalties
Maintain streaks. Missing a day can cost a small amount of coins or XP—adding healthy pressure.

### Stats & progress
Dashboard with streaks, strongest habits, peak productivity times, and XP/coin charts over time.
